# India-Population-Trends-Analysis-1955-2020-Power-BI-Dashboard
📊 India Population Trends Analysis (1955–2020) | Power BI Dashboard
📌 Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive demographic analysis of India’s population trends from 1955 to 2020 using Microsoft Power BI. The dashboard uncovers long-term structural shifts in population dynamics, demographic transition indicators, and migration patterns.

The objective of this analysis is to transform historical population data into clear, decision-oriented insights through advanced data modeling, DAX measures, and interactive visual storytelling.

🎯 Key Analytical Areas

The dashboard explores the following demographic dimensions:

Population Growth Trends

India’s Share of Global Population

Median Age Progression

Fertility Rate Changes

Urbanization Patterns

Net Migration Dynamics

Yearly Population Growth Rate

🔎 Key Insights
1️⃣ Long-Term Population Growth Slowdown

While total population continued to grow between 1955 and 2020, the yearly growth rate shows a consistent structural slowdown, reflecting demographic transition rather than temporary fluctuations.

2️⃣ Declining Fertility Rate & Rising Median Age

The analysis highlights:

A steady decline in fertility rate

A continuous increase in median age

This pattern strongly indicates India’s transition toward a more mature population structure — characteristic of late-stage demographic transition.

3️⃣ Migration Dynamics Shift

Net migration peaked around 1975

A noticeable decline after 2010

This suggests evolving migration dynamics in recent decades, possibly influenced by economic, geopolitical, and policy changes.

4️⃣ India’s Share of Global Population

India’s proportion of the global population grew steadily during the earlier decades before stabilizing as growth rates moderated.

💡 Conclusion

This dashboard illustrates how structured data modeling combined with advanced DAX logic can uncover deep demographic insights. The long-term slowdown in population growth, declining fertility rate, rising median age, and changing migration patterns collectively reflect India’s progression through a significant demographic transition phase.

This project demonstrates the ability to convert complex demographic datasets into meaningful, strategic insights using data visualization and analytical frameworks.
